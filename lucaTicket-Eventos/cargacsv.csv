3276,05/30/2016,12:00 AM,12:00 PM,Memorial Day,Memorial Day,Memorial Day was originally called Decoration Day and was initiated to honor the soldiers for the Union and Confederate armies who died during the American Civil War.  Celebrations honoring Civil War heroes started the year after the war ended. The establishment of a public holiday was meant to unify the celebration as a national day of remembrance instead of a holiday celebrated separately by the Union and Confederate states. By the late 19th century  the holiday became known as Memorial Day and was expanded to include the deceased veterans of all the wars fought by American forces. In 1971  Memorial Day became a federal holiday.The original national celebration of Decoration Day took place on 30 May 1868.,USA,Freedom - Remember,

The Orchestra was one of the successful and popular dance bands of the swing era.  In the early '40s  they produced a matchless string of hit records  radio broadcasts and live tour dates at theaters  hotels and dance pavilions.  At the beginning of WWII  during the height of the band's popularity  Miller joined the Army and formed The Glenn Miller Army Air Corps Band.  The group was a huge hit as it played all over Europe entertaining GI's and improving morale.  In 1944  an airplane carrying Major Glenn Miller to France disappeared over the English Channel.  Over 50 years since the public first embraced the Miller sound  both the legend and music live on and is timeless.  The orchestra of today  under the direction of Larry O'Brien  sells out all their shows.  O'Brien performs many of the original charts from both Miller's Army and civilian bands.
